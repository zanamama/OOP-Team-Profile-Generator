# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

My task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

Because this application won’t be deployed, I have provided a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. 




The following image shows a mock-up of the generated HTML’s appearance and functionality:



Your application should use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like the following example:

```md



## Grading Requirements

This homework is graded based on the following criteria:

### Deliverables: 15%

- A sample HTML file generated using the application must be submitted.

- Your GitHub repository containing your application code.

### Walkthrough Video: 32%

- A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the Team Profile Generator and passing tests must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.

- The walkthrough video must show all four tests passing from the command line.

- The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.

- The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.

- The walkthrough video must demonstrate a generated HTML file that matches the user input.

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

- Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following:

  - Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

  - Uses the [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for a suite of unit tests.

  - The application must have `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` classes.

### Repository Quality: 13%

- Repository has a unique name.

- Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

- Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

- Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

- Repository contains a high-quality readme with description and a link to a walkthrough video.

## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

- A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the application and passing tests.

- A sample HTML file generated using your application.

- The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a readme describing the project.
